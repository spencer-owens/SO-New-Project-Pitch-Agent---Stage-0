# S0 Pitch: [Your Reading App Name]

## 1. One-liner

### Format A: Business Structure
**Business structure one-liner**: For parents of PreK through second grade children who are reading below grade level or just starting to read, we help them reach grade-appropriate reading proficiency through research-backed phonics combined with AI-powered spaced repetition that requires minimal parental oversight.

**Natural restatement**: We help parents and teachers get struggling or beginning readers to second grade level through an AI reading app that teaches itself while parents and teachers track progress through recordings and dashboards.

### Format B: Movie Pitch
**Movie pitch**: It's like Duolingo meets Hooked on Phonics, but with FSRS spaced repetition algorithms and autonomous AI coaching that lets kids practice independently while parents see exactly what happened.

## 2. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### School Category
**Primary target**: Direct-to-parent customers (Twitter beta, then paid subscription)
**Future validation partner**: Alpha school collaboration with Nick Alsford and Kathryn Macfarlane of the Academics team

### Inclusion Rules

**Parent profile and setting:**
- Parents of PreK through second grade children (ages three through eight)
- Children who are either reading below grade level OR just beginning to read (includes both struggling readers and early learners)
- Parents actively seeking structured reading support beyond school instruction
- Parents who suspect dyslexia or other developmental reading issues and want early detection tools

**Technology and workflow:**
- Households with tablets or smartphones suitable for child use
- Parents comfortable with educational apps and willing to pay for learning tools
- Families where children can dedicate short, focused sessions (two to four minutes with good pacing)
- Parents appreciate progress visibility without requiring constant oversight during practice

**Income and engagement:**
- Household income sufficient for educational app subscriptions (twenty to fifty dollars per month range)
- Parents who research and invest in their child's academic development

### Exclusion Rules

**Development levels out of scope:**
- Children under age three who are still developing basic verbal and speech skills
- Advanced elementary students (grades three and up) who need different reading intervention approaches

**Settings that block success:**
- Households without consistent device access or reliable internet
- Families unable to maintain daily practice routines due to major schedule constraints

## 3. Strategic Narrative

### Why Now (Macro Timing)
AI-powered speech recognition and assessment have reached the accuracy and cost point where autonomous reading validation is finally viable at scale. What required expensive human tutors or constant parent supervision two years ago can now be delivered at software margins with comparable instructional quality.

### Status Quo / Enemy (Current Problem)
Early reading instruction is fragmented across ten-plus different apps, each with separate logins, systems, and data silos requiring heavy instructor management. Current solutions excel at single aspects but have fatal flaws: Mentava requires constant supervision at five hundred dollars per month, Amplify has good gamification but knowledge gaps, IXL has thorough content but sessions too long for young learners, Lalilo creates rigidity that leads to disengagement and crying children. Parents and schools pay thousands per year for this broken mosaic.

### Promised Land (Your 10x Improvement)
Children reach grade-appropriate reading proficiency through one comprehensive app that combines autonomous AI coaching, research-backed phonics sequences, and early learning disability detection. Parents get measurable progress without supervision overhead, schools eliminate the ten-app management burden, and children stay engaged through properly-paced micro-sessions.

### Proof (Why You Are Credible)
We have direct partnership with Alpha school's Academics team (Nick Alsford and Kathryn Macfarlane) providing curriculum expertise and future MAP score validation access. Early market validation includes a committed fifty-dollar pre-order from a current Mentava user frustrated with five-hundred-dollar monthly costs and supervision requirements. Our Twitter beta will provide rapid user feedback before school integration.

## 4. Distribution and Platform

### Platform Architecture
**Child app**: iOS app built with React Native, with web app backup (Next.js or React Native web)
**Parent dashboard**: iOS app (React Native) and web app (Next.js) for comprehensive access

### Day-One Access for Twitter Beta
Parents see targeted tweets or Twitter ads, click web link to signup portal, provide payment information (bypassing Apple's thirty percent fee), receive QR code to download child app from App Store. Children start using the iOS app immediately while parents track progress through web or iOS dashboard.

### Integration Plan for Alpha School
**School systems integration**: Will connect to TimeBack backend and Caliper events for seamless data flow
**Teacher dashboard**: Enhanced version of parent dashboard with additional classroom management tools and group progress tracking
**Student access**: Same child app, but provisioned through school accounts rather than parent payment

### Day-One Launch Sequence
Coordinated Twitter campaign (organic tweets plus targeted ads) drives traffic to signup website. Parents either pay fifty dollars upfront or access free trial with clear future pricing (fifty dollars per month). QR code redirect to App Store for immediate child app download. Heavy emphasis on feedback collection during beta phase.

### Potential Blockers
**For parent beta**: None significant - web signup avoids App Store approval delays, direct payment bypasses platform fees
**For school integration**: TimeBack and Caliper integration complexity, but Alpha school partnership provides direct technical support access

## 5. Measurable Outcome (The Centerpiece)

### 1. What you will improve (Primary Outcome)
**Primary outcome**: Reading level progression as measured by decoding ability and phonemic pronunciation skills using our proprietary diagnostic assessment based on UFLI phoneme sequences.

### 2. How much you plan to improve (Target)
**Target**: Statistically significant improvement in both decoding accuracy and phonemic pronunciation from pre-test to post-test (estimated at approximately ten percent improvement based on sample size).

### 3. How long it will take (Time Window)
**Time window**: Within thirty days of starting the app.

### 4. How you will measure it (Measurement Plan)
**Measurement plan**: Pre-test diagnostic during onboarding measuring baseline decoding and phonemic skills based on UFLI phoneme progression. Post-test using identical assessment after thirty days of app usage. Sample size of at least ten families from Twitter beta. Include forty-eight-hour delayed retention check to verify learning persistence, particularly important for pre-literate children experiencing their first structured reading instruction.

### 5. What counts as success (Decision Thresholds)
**Green (Success)**: Statistically significant improvement in decoding and phonemic pronunciation scores (approximately ten percent or greater improvement depending on final sample size and variance)

**Yellow (Needs Work)**: Positive improvements in scores that do not reach statistical significance threshold (below ten percent improvement range)

**Red (Not Acceptable)**: No improvement or regression in decoding and phonemic pronunciation scores

### Complete Statement
Our primary outcome is reading level progression measured by decoding ability and phonemic pronunciation using our UFLI-based diagnostic assessment. We aim to achieve statistically significant improvement (estimated at approximately ten percent based on sample size) within thirty days of app usage. We will measure this through pre-test and post-test diagnostics with at least ten families from our Twitter beta, including forty-eight-hour delayed retention checks. We will consider this successful if we achieve statistically significant improvement, needs more work if improvements are positive but below significance threshold, and not acceptable if scores show no improvement or regression.

## 6. Assumptions and Risks

### Assumption / Risk 1: Daily Engagement Consistency
**What we assume**: Children will consistently engage with two to four minute sessions daily when parents initiate, maintaining this routine over thirty days without session fatigue or resistance.

**How we will test it**: Track daily completion rates in week one. If completion drops below seventy-five percent by day five, we will adjust session length, add progression rewards, or modify pacing. Monitor engagement patterns daily and adjust immediately if trends decline.

### Assumption / Risk 2: Parent Conversion to Paid Subscription
**What we assume**: Twitter beta families will convert to fifty dollars per month subscription after experiencing autonomous learning benefits compared to supervision-heavy alternatives like Mentava.

**How we will test it**: Survey families at day seven about payment intent and price sensitivity. If fewer than sixty percent indicate willingness to pay fifty dollars monthly, we will test pricing tiers (twenty-five dollars, thirty-five dollars, forty dollars) and value proposition messaging. Gather conversion signals before thirty-day trial ends.

### Assumption / Risk 3: Twitter Audience Sample Size
**What we assume**: We will attract at least ten committed families from Twitter promotion based on existing engagement and two pre-committed users.

**How we will test it**: Launch Twitter campaign in week one with clear signup tracking. If signups fall below seven families by day five, we will expand promotion to parenting Facebook groups, Reddit communities, and ask existing engaged users for referrals. Adjust acquisition strategy immediately based on early response.

### Assumption / Risk 4: UFLI Diagnostic Sensitivity for Short-Term Progress
**What we assume**: Our UFLI-based assessment will detect meaningful reading progress within thirty days for pre-literate children just beginning phonemic instruction.

**How we will test it**: After first week, analyze assessment score distributions and variability. If pre/post differences appear too small to detect with our sample size, we will supplement with parent-reported milestones (first letter sounds learned, first words decoded) to triangulate progress evidence.

### Assumption / Risk 5: Autonomous Learning Without Technical Issues
**What we assume**: Speech recognition and app performance will work reliably enough on iOS devices that parents don't need to troubleshoot or intervene during sessions.

**How we will test it**: Monitor technical support requests and session completion rates in week one. If more than twenty percent of families report technical difficulties, we will immediately deploy fixes and provide direct technical support to maintain engagement.
